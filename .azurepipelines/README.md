# Azure Pipelines

This directory contains Azure DevOps pipeline definitions for the Azure DevOps MCP Server project.

## Pipeline Files

### CI/CD Approach: Separate CI and CD Pipelines ‚úÖ

- **`build.yaml`** - Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline
  - Triggers on commits to main branch (excludes `.azure/**` and deployment pipeline changes)
  - Builds and pushes Docker image to Azure Container Registry
  - Publishes deployment metadata for consumption by CD pipeline

- **`deploy.yaml`** - Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline
  - Triggered by:
    - Completion of the build pipeline (automatic container deployment)
    - Changes to `.azure/**` (infrastructure-only deployment)
    - Changes to the deployment pipeline itself
  - Deploys infrastructure using Bicep templates (from repository, not artifacts)
  - Conditionally updates container app (only when new build is available)
  - Performs health checks and notifications

- **`release.yaml`** - Combined build and deployment pipeline (legacy)
  - Single pipeline that handles both build and deployment
  - Kept for reference/fallback scenarios

## Key Features

### üéØ **Smart Triggering**
- **Code changes** ‚Üí Triggers build pipeline ‚Üí Automatically triggers deployment
- **Infrastructure changes** ‚Üí Triggers deployment pipeline only (no unnecessary builds)
- **Deployment pipeline changes** ‚Üí Triggers deployment pipeline for self-validation

### üîÑ **Flexible Deployment Modes**

#### 1. **Full Deployment** (Build + Deploy)
When the build pipeline completes:
- Downloads build metadata with new image information
- Deploys infrastructure using latest Bicep templates
- Updates container app with newly built image
- Performs health verification

#### 2. **Infrastructure-Only Deployment**
When only infrastructure changes:
- Uses latest available container image from registry
- Deploys infrastructure updates using Bicep templates
- Skips container app image update (no new build)
- Performs health verification

### üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure Management**
- Infrastructure files (`.azure/**`) are sourced directly from the repository
- No infrastructure artifacts are published by the build pipeline
- Deployment pipeline uses `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/.azure/main.bicep`
- Supports both new deployments and incremental updates

## Configuration

### Build Pipeline (`build.yaml`)

**Variables to configure:**
- `dockerRegistryServiceConnection`: Your Azure Container Registry service connection ID
- `imageRepository`: Name of your container image repository
- `containerRegistry`: Your ACR hostname

**Trigger Configuration:**
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
  paths:
    exclude:
      - .azurepipelines/deploy.yaml
      - .azurepipelines/release.yaml
      - .azure/**  # Infrastructure changes don't trigger builds
```

### Deploy Pipeline (`deploy.yaml`)

**Variables to configure:**
- `azureServiceConnection`: Your Azure service connection name
- `environmentName`: Target environment name (e.g., 'Production')
- `subscriptionId`: Your Azure subscription ID
- `location`: Azure region for deployment
- `azureDevOpsOrgName`: Your Azure DevOps organization name

**Trigger Configuration:**
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
  paths:
    include:
      - .azurepipelines/deploy.yaml  # Self-triggering
      - .azure/**                    # Infrastructure changes

resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: ci
    source: 'ado-mcp-ci'            # Build pipeline name
    trigger:
      branches:
        include:
        - main
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Service Connections:**
   - Container Registry service connection for pushing images
   - Azure Resource Manager service connection for deployment

2. **Azure Resources:**
   - Azure Container Registry (configured in build pipeline)
   - Appropriate RBAC permissions for subscription-level deployments

3. **Environments:**
   - Create Azure DevOps environments for deployment approval gates

## Deployment Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Code Change
```
Developer commits code changes
‚Üì
Build pipeline triggers (builds new container image)
‚Üì
Build pipeline completes successfully
‚Üì
Deploy pipeline triggers automatically
‚Üì
Downloads build metadata with new image tag
‚Üì
Deploys infrastructure + updates container with new image
```

### Scenario 2: Infrastructure Change
```
Developer modifies .azure/resources.bicep
‚Üì
Deploy pipeline triggers directly (no build)
‚Üì
No build metadata available
‚Üì
Deploys infrastructure updates + keeps existing container image
```

### Scenario 3: Pipeline Configuration Change
```
Developer modifies .azurepipelines/deploy.yaml
‚Üì
Deploy pipeline triggers to validate changes
‚Üì
Tests pipeline changes with current infrastructure/container
```

## Bicep Infrastructure

### Key Features
- **RBAC Authorization**: Key Vault uses modern RBAC instead of access policies
- **Managed Identity**: Container apps use user-assigned managed identity
- **Role Assignments**: Automatic RBAC role assignments for Key Vault and ACR access
- **Subscription Scope**: Deployment creates resource group and all resources

### Role Assignments
- **Key Vault Secrets User**: Allows container app to read secrets
- **Key Vault Secrets Officer**: Allows deployment process to create secrets
- **ACR Pull**: Allows container app to pull images from registry

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Pipeline Not Triggering Deployment:**
   - Check pipeline resource configuration in `deploy.yaml`
   - Verify the CI pipeline name matches `source: 'ado-mcp-ci'`

2. **Infrastructure-Only Deployments Failing:**
   - Ensure container app exists (infrastructure creates it)
   - Check that fallback image `hireground.azurecr.io/adomcp:latest` exists

3. **Permission Issues:**
   - Verify service connection has Contributor access to subscription
   - Check that managed identity has proper RBAC roles assigned

### Logs and Monitoring

- **Build logs**: Check Azure DevOps pipeline history for build issues
- **Deployment logs**: Monitor ARM deployment progress in Azure portal
- **Container logs**: Use Azure Container Apps logs for runtime issues
- **Application Insights**: Monitor application performance and errors

## Migration Notes

If migrating from the old combined pipeline approach:
1. Update pipeline references to use the new `build.yaml` and `deploy.yaml`
2. Ensure environment and service connection configurations are correct
3. Test both code changes and infrastructure changes to verify triggers work
4. Consider removing the old `release.yaml` once new pipelines are stable
